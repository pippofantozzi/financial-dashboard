# üß† App Plan ‚Äî "Personal Finance Tracker"  
**Next.js + Clerk Auth + Supabase**

---

## üéØ General Concept

An interactive finance dashboard where she:
- Adds transactions manually OR uploads her **extrato banc√°rio (bank statement PDF)**.
- Sees summaries, charts, and full reports.
- Organizes money leftover into **investments** or **savings buckets** (ex: "Holiday 2025", "New Car").
- Dynamically manages her own **categories**.

---

## üîê Authentication (Clerk)
- User signup/login with **Clerk**.
- Clerk's user ID used across the app.

---

## üóÑÔ∏è Database (Supabase) ‚Äî **Expanded Schema**

### Tables

   - id (UUID - Clerk)
   - email
   - name

2. **categories** (new!)
   - id (UUID)

## üß© Pages and Core UX

### 1. **Login / Signup Page**
- Using Clerk
- Basic onboarding (what the app does in 2-3 lines)

---

### 2. **Dashboard (Home)**
- Overview cards:
  - Net This Month
  - Total Expenses
  - Total Income
  - Best Saving Month Badge
- Line chart: Net worth per month
- Pie chart: Expenses by category
- **Monthly TL;DR** section
- Button: **Full Report** ‚Üí opens Sidebar

#### Current Chart Data Flow (Implementation Note - 28 Apr 2025):
- **Data Source:** Currently, all financial data (`transactions`, `categories`, `savingsGoals`, `monthlyBudget`) is **hardcoded as initial state** within the `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` component. No external data fetching (e.g., from Supabase) is implemented yet.
- **Data Processing:**
    - The `calculateMonthlyData` helper function in `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` takes the hardcoded data.
    - It groups transactions by month, calculates monthly income/expenses, aggregates expenses by category, and computes a running net worth.
    - This processed data is stored using `React.useMemo` for efficiency.
- **Chart-Specific Preparation:**
    - **Expenses vs Budget:** The card compares `latestMonthData.expenses` (derived from `calculateMonthlyData`) against the `monthlyBudget` state variable.
    - **Expenses Pie Chart:** The `expenseBreakdown` variable (derived from the monthly expense category aggregation in `calculateMonthlyData`) is passed to the `recharts` PieChart component. Colors are generated dynamically by the `chartConfigPie` function.

---

### 3. **Transactions Page**
- Table of transactions
- Filterable:
  - By Category
  - By Date
  - By Payment Method
- **Add Transaction Modal**:
  - Select Date
  - Amount
  - Category (Dropdown ‚Äî **dynamic**)
    - ‚ú® Option: "**+ Add new category**" inside dropdown
  - Payment Method
  - Description

---

### 4. **Current Month Page** (NEW - Extrato Upload)
- Big CTA: **Upload Extrato (PDF)**
- Upload a PDF ‚Üí Auto Parse:
  - Extract each line (Date, Description, Value)
  - Render a pre-filled table to review
  - Auto-suggest category "Uncategorized" initially
- Allow manual editing:
  - User can change categories inline before finalizing
- After confirmation ‚Üí Save transactions to DB.

_(For now, parsing can be dummy: just read text lines and split columns. Later you can improve with better parsing.)_

---

### 5. **Savings/Investments Page**
- View existing savings goals
- Progress bars (current vs target)
- "Create New Saving Goal" button
- Allocate monthly net into a savings bucket

---

### 6. **Monthly Reports Page**
- Card list of all months
- Summary TL;DR for each
- Button: Full Artifact Report Sidebar
  - Styled like Claude artifact
  - Markdown-friendly
  - Plan for next month inside

---
